# GEM-Webscraper
Webscraper for GEM (Government E Marketplace) 

I have included the Dockefile so that the script can be run without any additional setup as intended over docker . The script produces output as part of the logs and a JSON based file named scraped_bids.

If you want to run it as a standalone script , set up a virtual environment and install selenium . You will also require a headless browser (I used Geckodriver for firefox)
